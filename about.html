                  Mass Mesh is a high-tech social club building mesh networks to empower our neighbors and embody our values of mutual aid and local autonomy.
                  Our members are hackers, tinker-ers, organizers, artists, and dreamers. 
                  We all have one thing in common -- we're doing everything in our power to set the Internet free! 
                </p>

                  Our organization operates on the rule of two feet, and we move in solidarity with one another. 
                  When we want to see something done differently, we use our two feet to go do it! 
                  As a member of Mass Mesh, we don't have to do it alone. 
                  Good ideas get backing by the rest of us, and we swarm together to accomplish our goals.
                </p>

                    Giant corporations like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T have wrested control of our communications infrastructure. 
                    Because their sole aim is to extract a huge profit from their subscribers, 
                    they haven't invested in expanding access for all. Mass Mesh is a response to this massive inequity
                    and the design practices that created it.
                    Our core organizing principles are 
                    respect for privacy,
                    net neutrality,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_(organization_theory)"> mutual aid</a> and 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production">commons based peer production.</a>
                    We're just starting to gain traction, so now is the time to <a href="https://massmesh.org/wiki/index.php?title=Volunteer_Projects">get involved!</a>

Come ready to meet some incredible network engineers, and hopefully some kindred spirits. We're always looking to involve more people interested in helping us build our tech and our outreach strategy.</p>
