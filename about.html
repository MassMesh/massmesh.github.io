                  Mass Mesh a grass-roots organization committed to building the commons 
                  and empowering eachother to make the change we want to see in the world generally. 
                  Our members are hackers, tinker-ers, organizers, artists, and dreamers. 
                  We all have one thing in common -- we're doing everything in our power to set the Internet free!

                  Our organization operates on the rule of two feet, and we move in solidarity with one another. 
                  When we want to see something done differently, we use our two feet to go do it! 
                  As a member of Mass Mesh, we don't have to do it alone. 
                  Good ideas get backing by the rest of us, and we swarm together to accomplish our goals.

                    Giant corporations like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T have wrested control of our communications infrastructure. 
                    Because their sole aim is to extract a huge profit from their subscribers, 
                    they haven't invested in expanding access for all. Mass Mesh is a response to this massive inequity
                    and the design practices that created it.
                    Our core organizing principles are 
                    respect for privacy,
                    net neutrality,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_(organization_theory)"> mutual aid</a> and
